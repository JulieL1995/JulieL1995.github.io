        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> This project was made using the library <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, which provides a lot of functionality to make web sound applications.</p>
        <p> This application lets you explore the sound of the bagpipes. </p>
        <p> There are many different types of bagpipes all across the world. The most famous one is undoubtedly the Scottish bagpipes:</p>
        <img src="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2F1.bp.blogspot.com%2F_I4w-M7igu6w%2FS7oSDQOHuQI%2FAAAAAAAAAcA%2FDpAzow3pn28%2Fs1600%2Fbagpipes.jpg&f=1" style="width: 200px; hight: 300px">
        <p> The type used here however, is called Flemish pipes, from the region of France and Belgium. </p>
        <p> The sliders at the top let you adjust the volume of the three key pieces of the bagpipes: the bass drone, the tenor drone and the chanter. The chanter is the piece used to play melodies. 
            The colored buttons under the sliders let you play different notes on the bagpipes. When you click one of those buttons, you will hear the note. Also, on the picture you will see the finger placements of the note. </p>
        <p> Next to the colored buttons you see an text input box and an "add"-button. These are used to make a melody. Next to the note you need for your melody, put a positive, integer number into the input box. 
            This number is the length of the note. Then click "add". In the box at the bottom you will see that the note has been added. Add all the notes you need and click "play". The slider on top of the box allows you to change the speed of the melody. Also, use the "reset"-button to delete everything you put, and the "stop"-button to stop the playback of the melody. </p>
        <p> The music is made using real samples of a Flemish bagpipe (I got them from my father, who plays the bagpipes :) ). At first I tried to use these samples to do an FFT-analysis and then synthesize them, but the result was not really nice ^^.                  That's why I decided to use the real samples instead. </p>
