## Welcome to the Music & Audio Computing page of Julie Lelong

This is some very interesting information about the site. Everyone will read this, because it is very important. Nobody will think: "That looks like a lot of text. Let's just skip it." Because that's not how people are. People are not lazy. They will read this very carefully and remember everything and it will glorious! Glorious! 

## Anyway...

On this website you can find my assignments for the course "Music & Audio Computing".
